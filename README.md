# Simon Game: Memory Challenge (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)

This repository contains the code for a classic Simon game built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It provides a fun and challenging memory test for players.

# Features

1. Random sequence generation: The game generates random sequences of increasing length, testing player memory. 
2. Color-coded buttons: Players interact with the game by pressing buttons that match the displayed colors. 
3. Visual and audio feedback: The game provides visual (flashing colors) and audio (tones) cues for both the generated sequence and player input. 
4. Score tracking: The game keeps track of the highest score achieved. 
5. Increasing difficulty: With each successful attempt, the game adds another color to the sequence, making it progressively harder. 
6. Ending the game: The game ends if you fail to correctly repeat the sequence.

# Technologies Used

1. HTML5: Provides the basic structure and elements for the game interface. 
2. CSS3: Styles the visual elements of the game, including colors, animations, and layout. 
3. JavaScript: Handles game logic, including sequence generation, user interaction, and audio/visual feedback.
